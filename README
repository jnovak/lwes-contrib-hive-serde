LWES Journal File SerDe README

*** 
In order to read journal files from Hive, a SerDe (Serialize/Deserializer) 
is needed, to map Hive columns to LWES attributes.

***
Prerequisites
- JDK 1.6.x (http://java.sun.com/)
- Maven 2.2.x (http://apache.maven.org/)

***
How to build
% mvn clean package

*** 
How to install

Hive looks for extensions in a directory defined in the environment
variable HIVE_AUX_JARS_PATH. 
If that variable is not defined, set it to a directory of your choice
Copy JournalSerDe-x.x.x.jar into that directory and launch hive

***
Creating tables


This is an example of table creation.  
Just one event type is currently allowed per table.
The SerDe will automatically map a lwes attribute to the correspondent
hive column with the same name. Unfortunately, lwes attributes are case
sensitive while hive columns are not; you may also want a hive column
with a different name from the lwes attribute. In either case, you can
change the attribute/column mapping with serde properties as shown below:
the column sender_ip is mapped to the lwes attribute 'SenderIP'.
Classes for input/output are 
INPUTFORMAT  'org.lwes.hadoop.io.JournalInputFormat'
OUTPUTFORMAT 'org.lwes.hadoop.io.JournalOutputFormat'


CREATE TABLE mrkt_auction_complete_hourly (
        a_bid string,
        a_price string,
        a_act_id bigint,
	......
        x_revenue string
 )
PARTITIONED BY(dt STRING)
 ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.lwes.hadoop.hive.EventSerDe'
WITH SERDEPROPERTIES (
        'lwes.event_name'='Auction::Complete',
        'sender_ip'='SenderIP',
        'sender_port'='SenderPort',
        'receipt_time'='ReceiptTime',
        'site_id'='SiteID')
 STORED AS
        INPUTFORMAT  'org.lwes.hadoop.io.JournalInputFormat'
        OUTPUTFORMAT 'org.lwes.hadoop.io.JournalOutputFormat'
 ;


Also, lwes does not support FLOAT nor DOUBLE but hive does.
You can have define those columns as float/double and the serde
will convert its values according to Float.parseFloat(String) and
Double.parseDouble(String).

I also built a tool to create table definitions from the ESF file
and will post it too to sourceforge.

*** 
Limitations

Since LWES is basically a key/value format, it does not support nested 
columns so arrays and hashes are for now not allowed in a hive table that
uses this SerDe
